# Phase 8 --- SOAR Email Playbook (Azure Sentinel + Logic Apps)

> **Context**: Incidents are already being generated by the brute-force
> analytics rule. No Entra ID logs due to tenant permissions.  
> **Outcome**: Email notification fires for every **new Sentinel
> incident** created by the brute-force rule. RBAC is correct.
> Automation rule is attached. Test + evidence captured.

## Prereqs (one-time)

- Azure Sentinel workspace exists and is creating incidents from the
  brute-force analytics rule.
- You can send mail from either:
  - **Office 365 Outlook** (preferred) using your account or a
    shared mailbox; or
  - **SMTP** (fallback).
- You have rights in the subscription to create Logic Apps and assign
  RBAC at the **Sentinel workspace** scope.

---

## 1) Create the playbook (Logic App -- Consumption)

**Azure Portal** → search **Logic Apps** → **Add**  
- **Resource Group**: `rg-sentinel-automation` (or your RG)  
- **Logic App name**: `pbk-EmailOnNewIncident`  
- **Region**: same region as the Sentinel workspace  
- **Plan**: Consumption  
- **Review + create** → **Create**

Open the Logic App → **Designer** → **Blank Logic App**  
1. **Trigger**: search `Microsoft Sentinel` → select **Microsoft
Sentinel incident**.  
2. **Action 1 (comment)**: **Add comment to incident** → Comment:
`Playbook pbk-EmailOnNewIncident kicked off.`  
3. **Action 2 (email)**:  
   - Add action **Send an email (V2)** (Office 365 Outlook).  
   - **To**: your test email or distribution list  
   - **Subject**:
     `New Sentinel Incident: @{triggerBody()?['properties']?['title']}`  
   - **Body (HTML)**: includes Incident Title, Severity, Status, Workspace,
     Incident URL, ARM ID.

---

## 2) Enable and prepare the playbook identity (RBAC)

- Enabled **System Assigned Identity** on the playbook.  
- Granted **Microsoft Sentinel Responder** at the workspace level.  
- Verified ability to run playbook from incidents (Playbook Operator
  on RG).

**Obstacle:**  
- Initially tried "classic automated response" → saw Microsoft
  deprecation notice.  
- **Fix:** Migrated to **Automation rules** to attach playbook.

---

## 3) Attach the playbook using an **Automation rule**

**Microsoft Sentinel** → **Automation** → **Create automation rule**

- **Name**: `AR - Email on new incident (Brute Force)`  
- **Trigger**: `When incident is created`  
- **Condition**: Analytics rule name contains the brute-force rule
  name  
- **Action**: Run playbook → `pbk-EmailOnNewIncident`

**Obstacle:**  
- First automation rule didn't trigger because the query used
  `SecurityEvent | take 1` → no data when lab VMs (DC01/Client01) were
  off.  
- **Fix:** Switched query to `print test="ForceTestRow"`, ensuring
  incidents always generate for testing.

---

## 4) Test & Evidence

### Manual Test
- Ran playbook manually on a brute-force incident.  
- Verified Logic App **Run History → Succeeded**.  
- Email delivered successfully.

### Automation Test
- Triggered incident via `print test="ForceTestRow"`.  
- New incident created.  
- Automation rule ran playbook automatically.  
- Email notification received with proper HTML formatting.

**Obstacles faced and fixes:**  
- **Email body showed raw `<p>` tags**: fixed by editing code view and
  forcing `"IsHtml": true`.  
- **Indentation issues in Logic App code view**: discovered that Azure
  portal editor doesn't handle Tab. Used spaces / external editor to keep
  JSON readable.  
- **Delay in incident firing**: expected; resolved by switching to
  `print` query for guaranteed test signals.

---

## 5) Results

- **Every new Sentinel incident** from brute-force rule →
  auto-triggers playbook.  
- **Email notifications** contain clean HTML with clickable Sentinel
  Incident URL.  
- **Comment** added to incident confirming playbook execution.  
- Evidence captured:
  - Logic App creation review  
  - IAM RBAC assignment  
  - Logic App designer view  
  - Automation rule creation  
  - Logic App run history (Succeeded)  
  - Sentinel incident comment  
  - Email inbox screenshot with properly formatted notification

1.  `Logicapp-creation-review.png` — Logic App creation review blade  
2.  `IAM-RoleAssignment-SentinelResponder.png` — RBAC assignment  
3.  `LogicApp-Designer-Playbook.jpg` — Designer view (Sentinel Trigger → Comment → Email)  
4.  `Sentinel-AutomationRule.png` — Automation rule (incident created → run playbook)  
5.  `LogicApp-RunHistory.png` — Logic App run history (Succeeded)  
6.  `Sentinel-Incident-Comment.png` — Incident comment added by playbook  
7.  `Email-Inbox.png` — Email notification with clean HTML formatting

## Troubleshooting Quick Notes

- **Playbook not running**: Ensure trigger = Sentinel incident,
  automation rule scope = correct Analytics rule name.  
- **Manual run disabled**: Assign yourself
  `Microsoft Sentinel Playbook Operator` on RG.  
- **403 errors**: Playbook identity needs Sentinel Responder at
  workspace.  
- **Email plain text**: Add `"IsHtml": true` or
  `"BodyContentType": "HTML"` in code view.  
- **No incidents**: Use `print test="ForceTestRow"` for guaranteed
  testing when lab VMs are off.
